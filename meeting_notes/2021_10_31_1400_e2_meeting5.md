## Notes

- Escrow program is challenging so maybe a step back is needed.
- Lots of concepts and complexity.

- Perhaps make a simple voting smart contract fits skill level.
- Pilots can choose to make this Dapp in either pure Rust or Anchor.
- We can put our own spin on it much like we did for our wallet projects.

- Later, we can do a mini DAO, one we understand the voting concepts more.
- Make a mini DAO for each squadron where they vote on direction of the squad, etc.
- We can use existing wallet projects we made or people can vote from their Phantom wallet.
- Can possibly implement whitelist features to limit only pilots from that squadron to vote.
