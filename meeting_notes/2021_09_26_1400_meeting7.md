- For Let's Get Rusty Course, going up to Video 28 is good enough.
- This covers the first 15 chapters of the book.
- This helps give you a framework to consume Anchor content as there's Rust code in it.
- The other videos need more time to be developed by author.
- Good time to review other resources like Rustlings or Rust by Example.
- The last 5 chapters can be another resource for expedition 2.

- We'll do a show and tell on October 17th.
- Open up 3 squadron slots for people.
- Will wait on governance with tokens and voting.

  - Can be a feature down the line once the expeditions are more complete.

- Rotate some squad members out for new ones.
- Will contact inactive squad mates.

- Icarus forums is live.
- Need to adjust channels and organize the sections.
- Wait for setup before deploying 100%.
