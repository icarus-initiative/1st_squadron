## Notes

- Covered our rust and testing code.
- Still not functional yet due to problems of signature verification.
- Thread on discord:

```text
I am trying to write a vote system in Anchor. In the tests, when I pass this, I get an error.
Error: Signature verification failed
but if voter is => provider.wallet.publicKey, it works ok.
how is possible to write a test to check if that action can be done from different wallets?
---
It sounds like the voter is expected to sign then (the provider.wallet signs automatically)
---
It makes sense to me, but how can I add different wallet providers in the same test to see if it works?
---
I'm actually not sure the best way to use a totally different provider (maybe just call anchor.setProvider again?)
```

---

## Task List

- Continue with writing dapp.
- Write tests.
- Attempt to deploy.
- Test with real wallets on localnet or devnet.
