## Notes

- Joe McCann technologist/trader for 21 years.
- Microsoft Cloud
- Found Solana because of Proof of History.
- Shift from web 2.0 to web 3.0 for development.
- Solana sees same type of activity like NodeJS.
- Look at where developers are flocking to and where to invest time & energy.
- Same process happened in AWS.
- Ethereum has amazing developers but challenging to developers when they have to scale.
- If the end developer has better experience, it's better to invest there.
- It's not a completely new langauge like Solidity. Solana is similar path but slightly different.
- App ideas? Infrastructure work, Web2 style applications on Solana, social engaging app.
- 10x in experience or cost will cause massive shift. Otherwise, people will stick to web 2.0.
- Don't just bridge web2 apps.
- DAOs are one of the most underestimated phenomenons to hit the world recently.
- Trading future? Everything will go on chain, extends to financial instruments, Legacy finance might not go completely away, newer gen are less likely focused on index funds and more like metaverse, writing options contracts in in-game item
- Art is subjective and people have a traditionally upbidding each other.
- This generation is moving to NFTs, DRM, Royalties.
- NFTs are how people value things and it's an interesting subculture that can outperform the broad market.
- NFT communities that have social communities are more highly valued.
- Loot is another brilliant idea.
- Any other NFT idea? DefiLand
- Game publishing platform using NFT as initial game offering.
  - Utility in video games and special access levels.
- Another example, Friends with Benefit token needs to access their website.
- Usage of DEX like serum for traders? Room for all, uses DexLabs on top of Serum, & Aldron(?), Raydium, Phantom,, something that mimics central order book style, not same level of depth with AMMs.
- Hackathons? Meant to be fun, encouraging to expressive/innovative, don't lose sleep
